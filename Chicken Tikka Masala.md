**INSTRUCTIONS**

**For The Marinade**

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, ginger, garlic, spices, salt and pepper until combined.
    
2. Add the chicken and mix together until every piece of chicken is completely coated. You can use this right away or refrigerate for up to overnight for added flavor.
    

**For The Tikka Masala**

1. Heat a high sided sauté pan to medium high, and grease with cooking spray. Once the pan is hot, add all the chicken cubes and sear, without touching, for 2 minutes, or until golden brown on the first side. Flip each piece, and sear for 1 more minute. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside; the chicken will still be raw in the center at this point, so no tasting.
    
2. Lower the heat to medium and add the onion and season lightly with salt. Stir to combine and then add in the garlic and ginger. Sauté for 3 minutes or until the onion has softened.
    
3. Add the spices and stir to combine with the onions. Sauté for 30 seconds or until fragrant,
    
4. Stir in the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, and a splash of water. Season lightly with salt to taste. Increase the heat to medium high, and bring to a boil. Once it starts to boil, add the mixture to a blender and blend on high until it is as smooth as possible.
    
5. Return the blended mixture to the pan and add a splash of water to thin the sauce out slightly. Reduce heat to low and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the pan, and let simmer for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through and the sauce has reduced.
    
6. Add half and half, stir, and simmer for 3 more minutes.
    
7. Season to taste with salt, and serve immediately with 1 cup of rice per plate and garnish with cilantro leaves.
